# I-SAGE — iBLESS Analysis Pipeline

I-SAGE is a reproducible, Nextflow-based pipeline for analyzing **iBLESS** sequencing data and performing **genome-wide differential DNA double-strand break (DSB) analysis**, particularly under replication stress conditions.

The pipeline integrates alignment, break calling, normalization, visualization, differential statistics, validation, and sensitivity analyses into a single configurable workflow.

## Requirements

### Software

- Nextflow ≥ 22
- Java ≥ 11
- Python ≥ 3.9

### Python Packages

- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib

**Note:** Packages are typically managed via environment/profile on HPC systems.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
nextflow run workflows/iblesse_month2/main.nf \
  -profile eden_local \
  -params-file configs/iblesse.yaml
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section below.

---

## Configuration

Pipeline behavior is controlled via a YAML configuration file (e.g., `configs/iblesse.yaml`).

### Main Configuration Sections

#### 1. Break Calling (`break_calling`)
- Controls per-base or binned break calling parameters

#### 2. Visualization (`viz`)
- Visualization bin size or bin-size sweep settings

#### 3. Statistics (`stats`)
- Contrasts specification
- Replicate handling
- FDR thresholds
- EBV annotation options

#### 4. Validation (`validation`)
- Downsampling parameters
- Spike-in validation settings

A fully working example is provided in `configs/iblesse.yaml`.

## Differential Statistics

The pipeline performs robust statistical analysis across genomic bins:

### Method
- **Per-bin Fisher exact test** for break count differences
- **Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction** for multiple testing

### Advanced Options
- Replicate-aware analysis via Fisher meta-analysis

### Output Files
- All tested bins (full results)
- Significant bins (filtered by FDR threshold)
- Upregulated / downregulated bins (directional results)
- Volcano and MA plots (PNG + PDF formats)

---

## EBV Annotation (Optional)

If EBV contigs are present in the reference genome, I-SAGE can:

### Capabilities
- Annotate bins as EBV vs. non-EBV
- Quantify EBV enrichment among significant bins
- Report enrichment statistics in summary files

### Enable EBV Analysis

Add the following to your `configs/iblesse.yaml`:

```yaml
stats:
  ebv_regex: "(?i)^chrEBV$"
```

---

## Outputs

Results are organized under `outdir/`:

### Output Directory Structure

```
outdir/
├── viz/              # bedGraph tracks (per bin size)
├── stats/            # Differential statistics, plots, summaries
├── validation/       # Robustness and sensitivity analyses
├── reports/          # HTML reports and execution traces
└── logs/             # Pipeline logs
```

### Key Output Files

- **Visualization tracks** – BigWig/bedGraph format for genome browsers
- **Statistical tables** – TSV files with bin-level results
- **Plots** – Volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps (PNG + PDF)
- **Summary reports** – HTML and text-based summaries

## Documentation

Full documentation is under development and will be available in the `documentation/` directory, including:

- Pipeline architecture and design
- Module-level descriptions
- Statistical methods and validation
- Configuration guide and best practices
- Output interpretation and usage
